# 🚕 nyc-taxi-data-pipeline (NYC Taxi)

> A robust, production-grade Data Engineering Platform designed to handle the end-to-end lifecycle of the NYC Taxi dataset. This project demonstrates advanced data orchestration, transformation, and validation using the modern data stack.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** to ensure high data quality and reliability:

```
Raw → Processed → Curated
```

Each layer adds structure, quality, and business value to the data.
